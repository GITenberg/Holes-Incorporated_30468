<h1><span class="sp1">HOLES</span><br />
<b>INCORPORATED</b></h1>

<h2>By L. Major Reynolds</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> red-headed secretary asked,
"Names, please?"</p>

<p>"Ted Baker."</p>

<p>"Bill Stephens."</p>

<p>"To see H. Joshua Blair. We
have an appointment."</p>

<p>"It's for three-thirty. We called
up two weeks ago."</p>

<p>The secretary said, "Oh, yes. I
have you on the list." She checked
them off, studied them vaguely,
asked, "What was it you wanted to
see Mr. Blair about?"</p>

<p>Ted Baker held out the small
steel box he was carrying. "About
this."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;what is it?"</p>

<p>"It's a box."</p>

<p>"I can see that," the redhead
snapped. "What is it for? What
does it do?"</p>

<p>"It's for construction work. It
makes holes."</p>

<p>The girl sighed. It was late in the
day and she didn't care much, really.
She snapped an intercom button.
An inquiring voice rasped at
her. She said, "A Mr. Baker and a
Mr. Stephens to see you."</p>

<p>Evidently it was all right because
she snapped off the button and
pointed to a door. "In there."</p>

<p>They went in the door and faced
a desk large enough to play tennis
on. The man behind the desk gave
them a cordial snarl. "Well, what
have you got on your mind? And
don't take all day to tell me."</p>

<p>Ted extended the box. "This.
We'd like to sell it to you."</p>

<p>"What is it? A bomb?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. It makes holes. It makes
holes real quick."</p>

<p>Blair scowled at the box. "What
the hell do I want of holes?"</p>

<p>Bill Stephens came forward with
further explanation. "You see, sir,
Ted and I are inventors. We make,
well&mdash;things. We've been working
on this invention in our basement
and it seems to be a success."</p>

<p>"We don't quite know why it's a
success," Ted said, "but it is."</p>

<p>"We'd like to demonstrate it for
you."</p>

<p>"Well, go ahead and demonstrate."</p>

<p>Ted raised the box and aimed it
horizontally at nothing in particular.
He pressed a black button.
There was an odd whirring noise.
He took his hand off the button and
lowered the box.</p>

<p>"What are you waiting for?"
Blair growled.</p>

<p>"Nothing. That's it. I've made
the hole."</p>

<p>"Are you two crazy? What kind
of a fool trick&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Ted reached down and took a
pencil off the desk. "May I borrow
this?" Without waiting for permission,
he put the pencil carefully into
the place he'd pointed the box. Half
the pencil disappeared. He took his
hand away. The part of the pencil
still in sight didn't come with it. It
stayed where it was, lying in thin
air, horizontally, with no apparent
support.</p>

<p>H. Joshua Blair goggled and
turned three shades whiter. "Wha-wha-what
the hell!"</p>

<p>"And now, if you'll try to move
the pencil, the demonstration will
be complete."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Like</span> a man in a trance, Blair
got up from his desk and
grasped the pencil. It wouldn't
move. He got red in the face and
threw all his weight on it. It would
neither pull nor push. It stayed
where it was. Finally Blair backed
away from the thing. He leaned on
his desk and panted.</p>

<p>"You see," Ted said, "The hole
goes into the fourth dimension.
There's no other explanation. And
the fourth dimension holds solider
than concrete."</p>

<p>Old Blair's head was spinning,
but business instinct came quickly
to his rescue. "What happens," he
asked, "if something in the third
dimension is in the way?"</p>

<p>"It gets out of the way," Bill said.</p>

<p>Ted demonstrated. He trained
the box on the visible remains of the
pencil. It vanished.</p>

<p>Blair said, "Well, I'll be damned!"</p>

<p>"We figure this will save you a lot
of money in construction work,"
Bill said. "You can get along without
riveters. You just have a man
put holes in girders with this and
push the rivets through. You also
make holes for the beam-ends, and
your entire building will be anchored
in the fourth dimension."</p>

<p>"Do it again," Blair said.</p>

<p>Ted made another hole and put
another pencil into it. Blair grasped
the pencil and applied leverage.
The pencil snapped at the point it
entered the next dimension but the
broken end of the far piece was not
to be seen.</p>

<p>Blair asked, "You say you two
invented this gadget?"</p>

<p>"That's right," Bill said. "We've
got a workshop in my basement. We
invent in the evenings after we
come home from work."</p>

<p>"What do you work at?"</p>

<p>"I read gas meters. He's a clerk
in a supermarket."</p>

<p>"I suppose you want money for
this thing."</p>

<p>"We'd like to sell it, yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How much do you want for it?"</p>

<p>"Well, we don't know. What's it
worth to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing probably. Leave it here
a few days. I'll look it over and let
you know."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And don't call me&mdash;I'll call
you."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leave your address and phone
number with my secretary."</p>

<p>After Ted and Bill left, Blair
yelled, "Get me Jake Steadman in
the engineering department!" He
didn't bother using the intercom,
but his secretary heard him anyhow.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ted and Bill went to work on an
idea they had for the treatment of
leather. You dipped your shoes in a
solution and they lasted forever.
The thing didn't work too well,
however. It was full of bugs. They
tried to eliminate the bugs and once
in a while they thought of H.
Joshua Blair.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it's about time
he called us?" Ted asked.</p>

<p>"Don't be so impatient. He's a
big man. He owns a big company.
It takes time."</p>

<p>"He's had over a month."</p>

<p>"Relax. We'll hear from him."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Another</span> week passed, and
another, until one evening
Ted came galloping into the workshop
with news. "That big new addition
to the City Hall! They're
working on it! H. Joshua Blair Construction
Company. A big sign says
so!"</p>

<p>"Relax. You'll blow a tube."</p>

<p>"Relax hell! He's using our invention
to put up the steel girders.
Just like we suggested to him. Guys
with boxes like ours making holes
and putting in rivets!"</p>

<p>Bill stopped what he was doing.
"He said he'd call us. Maybe he forgot.
Maybe we better go see him."</p>

<p>They both knocked off work the
next day and got to Blair's office at
nine o'clock. The red-headed
secretary said, "You'll have to make
an appointment."</p>

<p>"Appointment hell!" Ted headed
for the inner door. Bill followed
him. They went into H. Joshua
Blair's office to find him in conference
with two vice-presidents.
Ted said, "Mr. Blair, we came&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who in the devil are you?"</p>

<p>"You remember us. Ted Baker
and Bill Stephens. We came about
our invention."</p>

<p>"What invention?"</p>

<p>"Our hole maker. You're using it
on the City Hall addition."</p>

<p>Blair glowered. "Where'd you get
the idea it was yours? Have you got
any patents to show?"</p>

<p>"Well, no. We didn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I did! Fourteen good solid
patents. You two better go peddle
your groceries."</p>

<p>"Now look, Mr. Blair."</p>

<p>Blair raised his voice. "Throw
these two bums out!"</p>

<p>Three huskies appeared as by
magic to do Blair's bidding. As Ted
and Bill landed on the sidewalk, one
of the vice-presidents said, "Do you
think that was smart, H. J.? They
might cause trouble."</p>

<p>Blair snorted. "They haven't got
a prayer. A meter reader and a
grocery clerk!"</p>

<p>"We could have at least given
them a few hundred."</p>

<p>"Not on your life. Never give a
sucker an even break, Jim. Give
them anything at all, we acknowledge
their claim. That'd be stupid."</p>

<p>"Maybe you're right."</p>

<p>"Of course I'm right. It's business.
Now about those other bids. By
gad! We can run every contractor in
town out of competition! They
can't touch our prices!"</p>

<p>Out on the sidewalk, Bill and Ted
sat mournfully looking up at the
vast steel skeleton, held together
literally by their own genius. Ted
said, "We got a raw deal."</p>

<p>"Maybe we had it coming. We
were pretty stupid."</p>

<p>"Anything we can do?"</p>

<p>"Doesn't look like it."</p>

<p>"Maybe the leather solution will
turn out."</p>

<p>"Maybe." Bill looked wistfully up
at the steel skeleton. "At even a cent
a hole, we'd have done all right."</p>

<p>"Let's go home and get to work."</p>

<hr />

<p>In the Mighty and Benevolent
Kingdom of Szkazia, a minor reign
of terror existed. The King, tired of
complaints from his subjects, had
just finished dressing down his
Prime Minister. The Prime Minister
was passing the abuse on to his
Chief Scientist. "If something isn't
done soon, I won't be responsible
for your head, my friend. The King
is in a rage."</p>

<p>The eyes of the Chief Scientist
watered&mdash;partly from fear, and
partly from nights and days spent
in his laboratory beating out his
brains on one idea after another.</p>

<p>"I'm doing my best, sire&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's not good enough! These
steel girders coming out of nowhere!
Banging people in the head&mdash;whacking
them in the stomach!
Why it isn't safe to walk through the
halls of the Administration Building.
Even the bedrooms of the Executive
Apartments are not safe! The
other night the Director of Propaganda
had just gone to bed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know of the incident," the
Chief Scientist said hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you do? But you've done
nothing about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've been working hard," the
scientist said patiently, "and I think
I have the solution. Give me another
day."</p>

<p>"One day, then. After that&mdash;"
The Prime Minister made a significant
slicing motion with his finger.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> Prime Minister chewed his
fingernails and watched the
clock. Sleep was out of the question
with the King calling up every little
while yelling for action. The
Minister counted the hours and
presented himself at the Royal
Laboratories precisely twenty-four
hours later. "Time's up," he
snapped.</p>

<p>The Chief Scientist was wiping
his face. There were new lines
around his mouth. He indicated a
small steel box. "I think I've got it,"
he said. "Come with me."</p>

<p>They went swiftly to the Administration
Building. "This should be
close enough. We depress this lever
and&mdash;and hope."</p>

<p>"Well, do it&mdash;do it!"</p>

<p>The Chief Scientist pushed the
lever on the steel box. A whirring
sound came from within. All the
steel girder ends in sight&mdash;all the
nasty little rivets&mdash;disappeared.
The Chief Scientist smiled and
wiped his face again. "It worked,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Excellent. I'll see that you get a
medal."</p>

<p>"Thank you," the Chief Scientist
said sadly. That was the trouble
with people nowadays. They either
handed you a medal or your head.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Ted</span> and Bill stared sadly at
the mess around the City Hall.
Bill said, "It's a good thing it collapsed
at night so nobody was
killed, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"You said it. I'd have felt guilty
if there'd been any casualties."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose went
wrong?"</p>

<p>"You got me. What do you think
they'll do to old Blair?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but it looks pretty
bad. They refused to let him out on
bail."</p>

<p>"Serves him right. The way he
treated us."</p>

<p>"You've got it wrong. He treated
us swell. He did us a big favor. We
could have been blamed for this."</p>

<p>Bill thought it over before saying,
"I guess you're right. I hadn't
looked at it that way."</p>

<p>"Let's go home and get to work
on the leather solution."</p>

<p>So they did.</p>

<p class="hd1">THE END</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
